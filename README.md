# geograPHUN Front End Demo

A personal extension on the geograPHUN app developed as our group project from Week 10 of the CodeClan Professional Software Development course. 

The original group project was to design a full-stack app using the Countries API data where users can: 
- play multiple, interactive quiz games;
- see their quiz scores and have them retained, even if they leave the app;
- view underlying information for each country so they can improve their quiz scores.

The code for the full-stack geograPHUN app as completed for the group project can be found in my [geograPHUN github repository](https://github.com/louise3112/geograPHUN).

Following completion of the group project, I took a further 1.5 days to refactor the front-end code to ensure it was DRY, more reusable and to allow me to host a [demo version of the app via Github pages](https://louise3112.github.io/geographun-demo/).
